👋 Hi there, I’m Ajith Joseph 😊

👀 I’m deeply passionate about full-stack development. Technologies like C#, .NET Core, React, and Azure really get me excited! 🚀

🌱 Right now, I’m diving even deeper into containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes. 🐳

💞️ Given my extensive experience in healthcare and finance, I’m always looking to collaborate on projects in these domains. Got something cool? Let's team up! 🤝
